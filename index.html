          that also offers <a href="#">Lighting</a>, <a href="#">Video</a>, and
          <a href="#">Laptop Dry-Hire</a> options from our Central London Base
          (Kings Cross). Whether your event is a small conference for 15+ guests
          or a theatre-sized conference with 300+ Guests, we have the equipment
          and the technicians that you’ll be needing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Sound Equipment includes <a href="#">Speakers</a>,
          <a href="#">Microphones</a>, Microphone Stands (Mic Stands), Cables,
          DI Boxes, Mixing Desks, and Amplifiers. We are also able to provide
          technicians as a standalone service too. Our unit is available for
          pre-arranged collections only, so please be sure to call ahead before
          visiting us! As well as London Speaker Hire, we also offer the
          following services.
        </p>

        <h4>Live Streaming Services</h4>
        <p>
          With Conferences being streamed online more and more with each passing
          week, why not consider adding a Live Stream to your event? This may
          allow both guests and speakers who were unable to attend the event to
          still play an active role. Our webcasting solutions include a Podium
          for your speakers to stand at (with a minimum of 1 fixed camera angled
          towards them at all times), and can also include a wider shot if you
          are planning on having a panel session at any point during the event.
          You will need to remind guests to ask their questions into the
          designated handheld microphone, or your remote guests will not be able
          to hear their questions.
        </p>

        <h4>Laptop Hire</h4>
        <p>
          Grand Technical has provided laptops for a range of events across the
          country. Whether you are planning a Conference, Exhibition, Coding
          Retreat, or Graduate programme, we have the right laptops for the task
          at hand. We only use the highest specification laptops on the market –
          from brands such as Dell, Hewlett Packard, and Apple. All of our
          Laptops are delivered with the full Microsoft Office Suite installed –
          which of course includes Word, Excel, Powerpoint, OneNote, Sharepoint,
          Teams, and Outlook.
        </p>

        </div>

        <p>
          If you need any other software to be pre-installed onto the laptops,
          such as Photoshop, Logic, Xcode, or any Final Cut Pro, be sure to let
          us know and we will endeavour to make this a reality for you and your
          guests/clientele.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of our laptops are delivered in smart, damage proof flight cases,
          and are fully tested one-by-one before being delivered; to ensure they
          are all in working condition. We are also able to include any amount
          of extension leads (power), mouse mats, mice, and keyboards where
          needed.
